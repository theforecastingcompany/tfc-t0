        The model predicts one whole patch at a time, so both ends have to line up. Padding
        on the left extends the context backwards until it starts on a patch boundary, which
        holds the patch grid fixed under the forecast window. Padding on the right fills out
        the forecast region, because reading ``H`` future steps means reading
        ``ceil(H / patch_size)`` whole patches after the context.

        Left padding is inert: ``MaskType.PAD`` (1), value 0.0 and ``-1`` sentinels. Right
        padding belongs to the forecast region, so it carries each row's own group id and
        variate type, and is ``MaskType.WITHHELD`` (4) on target rows and ``PAD`` elsewhere.

        ``context_end`` defaults to ``context_end(series)``, one host read; pass it where
        the layout is already known, e.g. inside a compiled graph.

        Reading the target row's mask, where 0 is an observation, 1 is padding and 4 is a
        step to predict -- a 3-step context with nothing to predict pads on the left only::

        A 4-step context is already aligned, so a 1-step horizon pads on the right only,
        rounding the forecast region up to a whole patch::

            >>> series = TimeSeries.from_array(torch.zeros(1, 1, 4), horizon=1)
